# Prediction
slip train test
define a ML for predicting outcome (binary classification)
confusion matrix
define metrics (F1 / AUPRC)
stratified metrics (output F1 / AUPRC for men vs women)

# Fairness
recap on confusion matrix
fairness metrics: Equalized Odds and Predictive Rate Parity are two most relevant (but there are more)
how to achieve fairness / mitigate bias
-> preprocessing
-> algorithmic tuning
-> postprocessing

# Groups
1. Improve the model (e.g., feature selection, from GLM to ML), but no fairness constraints
2. Improve the model: Pre-processing
3. Improve the model: Optimization
4. Improve the model: Post-processing

# Discussion
upload results to : xxxxxx google slides
results from performance metrics and fairness metrics
